<h2> 10/28/2021 9:33AM: First announcement in over a week lol. I added some new games and thats really it, just making an announcement to let you know I still update the site every now and then.</h2>
<h2> 10/19/2021 1:52PM: Stuff got blocked but I dont really care to remove it, I kinda gave up on this site. However I added fucking counter strike, click the link, if you dont have access, sign in with a PERSONAL E MAIL, not a school one. Look for counter strike, (or anything else), download it, unzip it, then read the how to play.txt file, and enjoy.</h2>
<h2>10/6/2021 2:27PM: Cool slope is back, fill out the game request forum please, I'm running low on games.</h2>
<h2> 10/4/2021 1:59PM: Well, Driving simulator and slope got blocked so I removed them. I updated the weekly picks and that's about all :/</h2>
<h2> 9/27/2021 10:28AM: It's been a while, just haven't done much big stuff to announce, just adding a few games every now and then, I will only use announcements for like big changes. Fuck forums, I can't find a good one and it's just too much of a struggle, however I have made a way to request games. I am pretty sure this site actually has users now, so that's cool.</h2>
<h2> 9/21/2021 2:24PM: Wow 2 announcements in 1 day, crazy. I added the weekly picks to make the front page have more stuff. Removed the stupid ass thing that says view changelog in announcements. Thats about all for today.</h2>
<h2> 9/21/2021 9:19AM: Keep trying to find a good forum thing, not getting too far. However I updated the site look, I've been trying to just make it look more sleek and actually good, rather than look like a joke which is why I made this site originally, as a joke, but now it's honestly really good and is probably some of the best work I've done with code with practically 0 tutorials, so yeah its coming along well.</h2>
<h2> 9/20/2021 12:58PM: I changed the font on the front page because being for real, that font was so ass, anyway, I added some new games, trying to get a cool gradient background, but its being stupid, still trying to get forums, might make an account feature.</h2>
<h2> 9/18/2021 5:44PM: Big news, i made the site a github link so now you can view it on the web, i added some nice backgrounds, and over all just fixed up the site, gonna be adding more games soon, forums are stilla WIP, however when they're done, feel free to post game requests.</h2>
<h2> 9/17/2021 1:34PM: Welcome to the first announcement, I am trying to get a host for this site so you dont need to download files an all that shit, in development news, everything is fine, forums are a bit of a struggle, but the links, background images, layout, and everything else is practically fine.</h2>
